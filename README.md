# AAIC 2017 Clinical Trial Methods Workshop

Educational Workshop: Contemporary Issues in Clinical Trials Methods
Friday, July 14, 2017
8 a.m. – 5 p.m.

This workshop will cover contemporary issues in clinical trials, which aid clinicians in selecting cost-effective trial designs. The workshop will cover: 1) adaptive trial designs 2) simulation and study enrichment 3) categorical vs. continuous-time analysis model 4) delayed start design. For reach topic, lectures will start with an overview of basic concepts, followed by more advanced topics, using practical examples. The targeted audience is clinicians and statisticians. The workshop will utilize some programming languages, but the aim is for clinicians to deepen conceptual understanding, as well as to provide statisticians with available resources.


## SESSION I
8:05 am - 10:20 am  (with 10 minutes break in the middle)   

### How to assess outcomes/endpoints– continuous time vs. categorical time 

Dr. Donohue 

**Hour 1**

1. Repeated measures/longitudinal/correlated data
2. t-test
3. Regression
  1. outcome/response variables
  2. predictors/covariates
4. ANCOVA
5. Linear mixed effects (LME) models
6. LME mean structure
  1. Continuous time (linear & quadratic)
  2. Categorical time

**Hour 2**

1. LME correlation structure
  1. Random effects
  2. Marginal models (generalized least squares)
2. Missing data: MAR, MCAR, MNAR
3. Multiple imputation


## SESSION II

10:30 am – 11:50 pm   

### Simulation and Trial Enrichment 

Dr. Leoutsakos

1. Basics of Hypothesis Testing
  1. Relationship between sample (what you have) and population (what you make an inference about)
  2. Null and Alternate hypotheses
  3. Type I error, Type II errors
  4. What is alpha, beta/power, what is a p-value?
  5. How to boost power? (N, precision, effect size)
2. Fundamentals of Simulation
  1. Brief introduction to R
      1. R Cran Website
      2. Basic commands: assignment, matrices, random draws/setting seed, loops, fitting a model.
  2. Simulating data under the null to obtain alpha
  3. Simulating data under one or more alternate hypotheses to obtain beta/power
      1. Choosing which alternate hypotheses to simulate
      2. Demonstration of code for mixed effects model (slope comparison)
      3. Demonstration of code for MMRM
      4. (Brief) enumeration of the assumptions made in simulations

## LUNCH BREAK
11:50pm – 1:00 pm


## SESSION II (Continued)
1:00pm-1:50pm

### Simulation and Trial Enrichment (continue). 

**Sample Enrichment**

1. Understanding a sample as (probably) arising from a mixture of populations
  2. Evidence from Cache County DPS and elsewhere (?) showing variability in course of dementia, as compared to clinic samples. 
2. Sample enrichment as one means of boosting power
  1. Through changes in precision
  2. Through changes in effect size 
3. Demonstrating possible effects of sample enrichment through simulation
  1. Enumeration of assumptions in enrichment simulations
  2. Enrichment may limit sample to a very specific subpopulation, with regard to type and/or stage of disease.
  3. Treatments may be effective for only a specific stage and/or type of disease. Enrichment may exclude the subjects for whom the treatment might have been successful.
  4. Other general issues of reproducibility/generalizability.

## SESSION III
2:00pm – 4:10pm (with 10 minutes break in the middle)  

### Adaptive Trial Design 
Dr. Chang

1. What is adaptive design? Motivation
2. Adaptive design vs. conventional trials
3. Types of adaptive design trials
4. Components of an adaptive trial
5. Learning-stage adaptive designs
6. Confirmatory adaptive designs
7. Challenges, obstacles, and controversies
8. Applied areas that would benefit from adaptive designs
9. Examples
10. Future prospects
11. FDA and EMEA guidelines

## Expedition trial design: Delayed Start Analyses Q & A
4:20pm- 4:55pm 

Dr. Hong Liu Seifert 

4:55:  Participants survey,  adjourn
